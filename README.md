# Smart Agriculture Analytics Project

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural data using Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover meaningful insights related to crops, rainfall, soil nutrients, fertilizer usage, and production patterns across different Indian states and districts.

The overall workflow includes:
- **Python** for data cleaning, preprocessing, merging multiple datasets, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **SQL (MSSQL)** for analytical querying, advanced joins, window functions, and generating insights directly from structured data.
- **Power BI** for building an interactive dashboard that visualizes the agricultural trends and patterns.
